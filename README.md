## Description

I created Nebula to keep track of things that are important to me. So far, I have implemented a diary (write down a few memories every day) and a habit tracker (a.k.a. daily todos).

I am currently developing a workout planner (for calisthenics athletes & gym rats).

Future updates will bring a meal planner (calculate your kcal & macro goals) and diary entry collections (save important events in your calendar).

## Hosted Application

The application is already usable through netlify under <a href="https://magnificent-rugelach-0a7290.netlify.app/">this link</a>.
